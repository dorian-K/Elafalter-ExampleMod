Elafalter ExampleMod
====================

Example Script for Elafalter

You can find a more detailed getting started guide [in the wiki](https://github.com/dorian-K/Elafalter-ExampleMod/wiki/Getting-Started)!

Requirements
------------

1. [git](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/latest)
2. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Getting started
---------------

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/dorian-K/Elafalter-ExampleMod.git`
2. `cd Elafalter-ExampleMod`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. `npx webpack` to bundle all source code into a single file
5. Import the bundled file (in `/dist/bundle.js`) as a single file inside the Elafalter launcher!
   
You are now ready to develop scripts for Elafalter! Whenever you change your code, webpack will automatically repack your script into a new bundle, and Elafalter will reload it automatically!

The SDK definitions inside `/src/sdk/index.d.ts` are autogenerated by Elafalter. You can generate them yourself by using the command `.dump` inside the Elafalter Console and copying the resulting file from the Roaming State folder (`%localappdata%\Packages\Minecraft\RoamingState\sdk.d.ts`)
